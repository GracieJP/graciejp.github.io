[Jeremy.Richards.dev](https://jeremy.richards.dev) is:

* A personal website belonging to the titular individual
* Based on the minimal knowledge of a backend developer with a MechE B.S.
* Lovingly hand-crafted, and [quite small](TODO)
* Unapologetically mobile second
* Going to use the typefaces [Merriweather by Eben Sorkin](), [Montserrat by Julieta Ulanovsky](), and [Some TBD code font](TODO)
* Currently hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://github.com/jeremysprofile/jeremysprofile.github.io)
* Built using [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/), which is released under the [BSD 2-clause license](https://github.com/mkdocs/mkdocs/blob/master/LICENSE).
* Eventually going to be [W3C-validated HTML5](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fjeremy.richards.dev%2F)
* [Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/) licensed
    * Except for the [icons]() which I believe will be [MIT Licensed]()
    * And the [GitLab scrollbars](), which I took from [GitLab's Docs](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-docs), which are also provided under a [modified MIT license](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-docs/-/blob/master/LICENSE).
    * If you really want, you can [contact me](https://jeremy.richards.dev/contact) if you'd like a different one
* Slow going
